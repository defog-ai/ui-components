# Defog's UI components

## Developing/Testing

All component source files live inside `lib/`.

To "Test" this folder aka actually see your components, the stuff is inside `test/`

Test locally using the following commands in project root:

1. `npm i`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Open `localhost:5173/` in your browser

Now you can go into `test/App.jsx` to see your components! Any changes you make to your code inside `lib/` will be reflected immediately.

When done with improvements/edits, push to this repo and (maybe) notify others that they would need to run `git pull` in their repos for this submodule.
